# SNS_Programming_Assignment
This Repo contains all the code and final report pertaining to the signals and systems programming assignment


In this we have to calculate the discrete time fourier transform of the given signal and plot it against it's corresponding frequency. 
We are considering 3 different sampling frequencies of 500, 2000 and 16000Hz. We have decided to make this assignment challenging for ourselves by using C++ instead of python/matlab where plotting graphs is much easier.
